Code Snippet Studio is an [extension for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/803e021c-fce2-4637-a05d-bb078cffc492) that makes it easy to create, edit, package, and share IntelliSense code snippets for **Visual Studio 2022**. For C# and Visual Basic snippets, it also provides live [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) code analysis as you type to immediately detect code issues.

[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/AlessandroDelSole/CodeSnippetStudio/blob/master/CodeSnippetStudio_StandAlone/Assets/Code_Snippet_Studio_User_Guide.pdf)

With Code Snippet Studio, you have a fully-functional code editor with syntax highlighting, basic IntelliSense, and live code issue detection as you type, where you can write or paste your snippets and supply the information that is required by the respective schema references. Studio will generate the proper .snippet files for you. You will then be able to package a number of code snippets into a Visual Studio extension by building .vsix packages that you can share with other developers and that you can even publish to the Visual Studio Gallery! Additional tools are available to work with both .vsix and .vsi installers.

Code Snippet Studio has been built using controls from [Syncfusion's Essential Studio for WPF (Community license)](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense)
